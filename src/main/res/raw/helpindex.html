<a name="instructions"><h2>How to Play</h2></a>
Sokoban is a logic puzzle game. You play a warehouse keeper (the circle).
You need to put the boxes in their proper place, marked in dark-gray. However,
you can only push the crates from behind, and only one crate at a time.</p>

You'll also find the latest version of this application, as well as the source
code.</p>

The actual puzzles were taken from the 'ksokoban' game in the KDE 3.0 game
suite.</p>
