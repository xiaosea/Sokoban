Sokoban
=======

This is a sokobandroid-based product.The original android source code is available at https://code.google.com/p/sokobandroid

The actual Sokoban level files were created by David W.Skinner - See
his site at http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/



Since I'm bad at drawing, I took quite a lot of ready made graphics
from around the web: 
The target location image is from the Desktop KSokoban game - See
http://hem.passagen.se/awl/ksokoban/.

The launcher icon is from
https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/61566/box_wooden_icon#size=512

The graphics for the movement buttons is from
https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/sphericalcons. Many more are available there.

the cute Gingerbread man was created by ZeusBox studios, and is
